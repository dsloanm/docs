# Charmed HPC

Charmed HPC is a platform for managing high-performance computing clusters. It automates the lifecycle of essential cluster software and processes, such as workload management, shared storage, GPU access, and high-bandwidth networking. This allows operations teams and systems administrators to focus on running workloads rather than maintaining infrastructure.

## How this documentation is organized

This documentation uses the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation structure.

* The [Tutorial](tutorial-getting-started-with-charmed-hpc) takes you step-by-step through building a small Charmed HPC cluster, submitting batch jobs, and using container images.

* [How-to guides](howto/index) assume you have basic familiarity with Charmed HPC. They cover key operations for [deploy](howto/deploy/index.md), [integration](howto/integrate/index.md), [management](howto/manage/index.md), and [usage](howto/run-workloads/index.md).

* [Reference](reference/index) provides technical information such as [underlying projects and dependencies](reference/underlying-projects-and-dependencies.md), [monitoring](reference/monitoring/index.md), and [performance benchmarks](reference/performance.md).

* [Explanation](explanation/index) includes topic overviews, background and context, and detailed discussions of key concepts.
